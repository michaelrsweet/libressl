LibreSSL NuGet Packages for Visual Studio 2019+
===============================================

The `libressl_native` and `libressl_native.redist` packages provide precompiled binaries
for the [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/) project, which itself is a fork of OpenSSL
that was done by the OpenBSD Foundation.

Functionally LibreSSL provides the same C API as the OpenSSL project, just with less code.
